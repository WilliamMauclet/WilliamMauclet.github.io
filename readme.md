# RUIMTEJAGER

A small game-project to learn JavaScript.

The game consists of a spaceship (the player) that must explore the map, 
destroy enemy drones and alien structures with laser bolts. The alien 
structures can shoot rockets and are modular (can be destroyed rocket-
sending piece by piece). 

This project is open source.
